## Plans Week 13
> Weeks Plans
- Monday: ***Check #announcements daily, Form Teams, Pick Teaching Topic, GDP, Setup Team, Carry over or establish new Projects and Team repositories, Establish scrum board*** . Teachers will have very ***little tolerance for tools that are not working!!!***  Verify Tools, Fastpages Kernels, WSL, and Anaconda as applicable (Due Friday).
- Tuesday: [Harvard CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/weeks/0/) minute 0 to minute 50 to provide background on binary, complete all 50 minutes recommended
- Wednesday: Binary Logic and Abstractions
- Thursday: Work Day
- Friday: ***Tools and Issue Verification Due**

## Trimester 2 Pre-Holiday Objectives
> <mark>Unit 2 and Unit 3 mastery.</mark>
- Students needs to master Big Idea 3 Algorithms and Programming from College Board online curriculum prior to winter break.
- Students should master Unit 2, topics 2.1, 2.3, and 2.4 before winter break.
- Teams will share a lesson.
    - Every team must present and be clearly involved in preparation.  Review tickets are required for each student with links to tangibles.
    - In lesson preparation and teaching students should try to use Binary as data in lessons.  All algorithms need data and there are many applications of Binary that can support the Algorithms from College Board Unit 3 
     - Exceptions can be made to Binary.  But, this must be discussed with Teacher in advance.
- Students will be working with Fastpages, ***Jupyter Notebooks: Python, JavaScript kernels.*** Additionally, students will work in ***Frontend JavaScript code in Fastpages Markdown files*** (see [Frontend Examples](https://nighthawkcoders.github.io/APCSP/frontend/overview).
- Through the Trimester students will be expected to ***present Fastpages/Blog with Homework assignments and one-to-many Frontend JavaScrip web applications.**

## Trimester 2 Post-Holiday Objectives
> <mark>Create Performance Task completed.</mark>
- After additional Data and Algorithm mastery in initial 5 weeks of trimester... students and teams will ***transition to "Create Performance Task" projects***.  12 hours of class time will be allocated to this task over the final 7 weeks.  Additionally, you will use this project in Trimester 2 N@tM presentations.  
    - Be sure to have an ***interactive portion to this project***, this is key to College Board Video and N@tM presentations.
    - During the 7 weeks we will be ***learning more about APIs, creating Frontend forms, storing forms in Databases, posting comments, uploading (images) and continuing with likes.  As we transition to Trimester 3 we will creating user login and site security.***
    - ***Plan your Create Performance Task with these features in mind.*** FYI, 1-4 people can work on a project, but everyone must have there own feature that represents all the College Board requirements.
    - We will have Tech Talks in Career Tech, AP Test and Human Development during the last 7 weeks.

## Tools and Issue Verification (3 points)
> <mark>Summary of Points.</mark>
- Individual Tools Verification, VSCode, JavaScript and Python Kernels working on Laptop/Desktop.  "Python Jupyter Notebook" and "Javascript Fastpages Markdown files will be key technical platforms.  If you have problems currently, go back and re-install tools from 1st trimester guide.  Be sure VS Code is running out of Anaconda environment.  Perform ***make server*** to pretest prior to commits.  Show ***running code*** in Fastpages for Binary Markdown and FastPage Python. 
- ***Plan Individual Binary Logic and Abstraction Hacks.***  Create ***Individual Issue*** with checkboxes. Look at Hacks for Binary Logic and Algorithms and build all issues that you interpret as valuable/required!!!  Plan something new.  ***Consider redesign and how many different Markdown files you will need.***
- ***Plan Team Lesson and Issue(s)***, requires checkboxes!!!
    - Consider ***using Binary project to supplement learning.*** Consider Career Tech blogs as supplemental Topics/Hacks for week.  ***Coordinate with other Teams for the same week***, all projects should be coordinated in Python Notebooks or Fastpages Markdown on the same week (one student deliverable location).  Coordinate on Homework.
    - Objective in ***each lesson is to teach Algorithm and key Data topics at the same time.***  Make sure Jupyter Notebook or Frontend code is created for homework.  Homework should be limited to 30 minutes.  Publish and receive materials on Comment page of blog.
