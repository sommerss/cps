## Intro Class Logistics (Del Norte desires title by end of meeting)
> Idea is to have a course to focusses on freshman/sophomore classes. The purpose at Del Norte, is to add to the beginning of the pathway that feeds into AP Computer Science Principles (CSP).
- 1 trimester course of App Design or Game Design
- 2 trimester course of App Design and Game Design

## Pathway
> The Pathway modifications at Del Norte High School with Intro course.
1. 24 Weeks. Intro to Computer Science, no experience
2. 36 Weeks (contract required). AP CSP, Data Structures 1 is targeting 10th-11th, prerequisite is Intro to Computer Science, waiver of Intro requires experience in Technologies taught in Del Norte program.
3. 36 Weeks (contract required). AP CSA, Data Structures 2 is targeting 11th-12th, prerequisite CSP and DS1, no waiver, minimum starting point is CSP 

### Start with:
- Scratch Introduction
- Course Plans
    - Introduction to tools (e.g. IDE and Github)
    - Fundamentals in Programming in selected language (C# or Scratch)
    - Agile Development Fundamentals, Pair Programming, 

### Move on to main focus:
- [Create an Apple App using Xcode and Swift](https://www.apple.com/education/k12/learn-to-code/)
    AND/OR
- [Unity Game Development Curriculum](https://learn.unity.com/course/teaching-game-design-and-development)

## Certificate Programs
> Certificates are available online and at many avenues (Udemy, LinkedIN, Apple, etc).  Teachers could/should learn and then perhaps teach courses that are aligned to certificates by an organization like LinkedIn.  This would enable Teachers and District to confidently state that their Teachers are current to CTE advisors.
### LinkedIn Certification Programs for Development Engineering Methodology
> Skills to assist in teaching Project Based Learning.

- [Github Issues](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/github-issues-and-projects-for-teams)

- [Agile Development](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/paths/become-an-agile-software-developer)

- [Devops Engineer](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/paths/become-a-devops-engineer)

### LinkedIn Certificates for Programming
> Certificates to assist in teaching Intro to Programming, Computers Science Principles, Computer Science "A" development.

- [Intro Scratch](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-scratch)

- [Intro C# Developer](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/paths/getting-started-as-a-c-sharp-developer)

- [Intro Swift Developer](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/paths/master-swift)

- [CSP Python Developer](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/paths/become-a-python-developer-8969630)

- [CSP - JavaScript Developer](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/paths/become-a-javascript-developer)

- [CSA - Java Developer](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-java-4)


## Articulation Programs
> There has been movement by Del Norte and Mira Costa College regarding articulation. This begins with students taking CSP/DS1 in Fall of 2022, it completes with students finishing CSA/DSP2 in Summer of 2024, receiving credit for [CS113 â€“ Data Structures](https://catalog.miracosta.edu/disciplines/computerscience/#courseinventory).

```
CS 113: Basic Data Structures and Algorithms

Units: 3
Prerequisites: CS 112.
Acceptable for Credit: CSU, UC
Lecture 2 hours, laboratory 3 hours.
Course Typically Offered: Fall, Spring, and Summer
```

- The course uses topics of personal and social relevance to investigate the impact of computing through efficient algorithms and properly designed data structures. Students explore the software development process by developing effective solutions using industry-standard tools. Topics include searching, sorting, hashing, algorithm analysis, object-oriented design, collections, lists, stacks, queues, trees, sets, dictionaries, and graphs. C-ID COMP-132.

## Del Norte 2022-2023 Course Outlines and Student Projects
> Del Norte Materials are all online and maintained in GitHub.  Content produced is automatically deployed to a public Website.
